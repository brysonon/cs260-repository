# Caregiver Tool

I am currently working as an at-home caregiver for an elderly family member. Caregiver Tool, my startup application, would allow at-home caregivers like me to record their patients' vitals, track their health over time using graphs, and message other caregivers/healthcare providers. The main page displays the patient's current vitals and historical graphs, and these statistics can be updated and recorded in the spreadsheet page. When issues arise, a doctor, at-home nurse, or fellow caregiver can be messaged and notified.

* Display graphs of historical data
* Pain level tracker
* To-do list for patient
* Record vitals on spreadsheets that update main page in real-time
* Message healthcare providers and other caregivers

Notes about console assignment: 
This was a great experience. I learned a ton about repositories and cloning them to my computer. I learned how to push and pull changes. I learned how to edit my files using the console and GitHub. 
Steps to remember: git pull, git add ., git commit -m "(insert message)", git push
Also: check what directory with cmd and change directory with cd

Notes on simon project:
This project was a lot of fun and solidified my understanding with HTML structure, content, and layout. I had fun experimenting with different HTML elements. I also became a lot more comfortable with pushing my local development edits to my repository and constantly checking to make sure my progress was saved. I want to remember the console command: ./deployFiles.sh -k /keys/mykey.pem -h mydomain.click -s simon to deploy to my production environment. Head to simon.brysonon.com to check it out!
