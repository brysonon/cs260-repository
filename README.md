# Caregiver Tool

I am currently working as an at-home caregiver for an elderly family member. Caregiver Tool, my startup application, would allow at-home caregivers like me to record their patients' vitals, track their health over time using graphs, and message other caregivers/healthcare providers. The main page displays the patient's current vitals and historical graphs, and these statistics can be updated and recorded in the spreadsheet page. When issues arise, a doctor, at-home nurse, or fellow caregiver can be messaged and notified.
