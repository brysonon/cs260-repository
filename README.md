# My first repository
My name is Bryson On. This is my startup project for CS 260 and my first repository on GitHub. I love soccer, guitar, and my family!
This is my console change and my GitHub change

This was a great experience. I learned a ton about repositories and cloning them to my computer. I learned how to push and pull changes. I learned how to edit my files using the console and GitHub. 

Notes on simon project:
This project was a lot of fun and solidified my understanding with HTML structure, content, and layout. I had fun experimenting with different HTML elements. I also became a lot more comfortable with pushing my local development edits to my repository and constantly checking to make sure my progress was saved. I want to remember the console command: ./deployFiles.sh -k /keys/mykey.pem -h mydomain.click -s simon to deploy to my production environment.
