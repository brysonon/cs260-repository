# Caregiver Tool

Notes about console assignment: 
This was a great experience. I learned a ton about repositories and cloning them to my computer. I learned how to push and pull changes. I learned how to edit my files using the console and GitHub. 

I am currently working as an at-home caregiver for an elderly family member. Caregiver Tool, my startup application, would allow at-home caregivers like me to record their patients' vitals, track their health over time using graphs, and message other caregivers/healthcare providers. The main page displays the patient's current vitals and historical graphs, and these statistics can be updated and recorded in the spreadsheet page. When issues arise, a doctor, at-home nurse, or fellow caregiver can be messaged and notified.

Notes on simon project:
This project was a lot of fun and solidified my understanding with HTML structure, content, and layout. I had fun experimenting with different HTML elements. I also became a lot more comfortable with pushing my local development edits to my repository and constantly checking to make sure my progress was saved. I want to remember the console command: ./deployFiles.sh -k /keys/mykey.pem -h mydomain.click -s simon to deploy to my production environment.
